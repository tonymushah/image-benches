# image-benches

Hi everyone!

It's me again, Tony Mushah, with another test repository.

This time, I'm going test the [image][image-crate] crate to find if it's a good solution for the emdx packages.

## Goal

- [x] Find the best image format for file size: JPEG
- [ ] Find the best image format for transcoding (it includes performance) : BMP
- [ ] Find the best image format for zstd compression

## Images References

I will be using the [Chapter 53 Volume 9 of Fuufu Ijou, Koibito Miman, the english scanlated version] which is normally available on MangaDex

__And, of course, I recommend you to read it :3 __
